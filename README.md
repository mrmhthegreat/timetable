## Project Overview

The Timetable Generator is a Python-based application designed to automate the creation of conflict-free school timetables for Junior Kindergarten (Jr. KG), Senior Kindergarten (Sr. KG), and 1st Standard. The system processes input data specifying subjects, teachers, classrooms, and constraints to generate schedules in Excel format, minimizing scheduling conflicts and reducing manual effort. This tool is intended to assist educational institutions in efficiently managing their timetabling needs.

The project is functional but requires enhancements to improve usability, robustness, and feature completeness. Contributions from the community are welcome to address these areas.

## Features

- **Automated Scheduling**: Generates timetables based on input constraints, ensuring no conflicts in teacher or classroom assignments.
- **Excel Output**: Exports schedules in a structured Excel format for easy review and distribution.
- **Customizable Constraints**: Supports configuration for subject requirements, teacher availability, and school-specific rules.
- **Scalable Design**: Adaptable for various grade levels and institutional requirements.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and Excel output generation.
  - Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Output Format**: Excel (.xlsx)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrmhthegreat/timetable.git
   cd timetable
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify Setup**:
   Confirm Python 3.8 or higher is installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Input Data**:
   - Provide input files (e.g., CSV or JSON) with details on subjects, teachers, classrooms, and constraints.
   - Example input format (see `data/sample_input.csv`):
     ```csv
     Subject,Teacher,Grade,HoursPerWeek,Room
     Math,John Doe,Jr. KG,3,Room A
     English,Jane Smith,Sr. KG,2,Room B
     ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The script processes the input and generates a timetable in Excel format (e.g., `timetable_output.xlsx`).

3. **Review Output**:
   Open the generated Excel file to view the timetable, organized by grade, day, and time slot.

## Areas for Improvement

The Timetable Generator is a work in progress, and several areas require enhancement. Community contributions are highly encouraged to address the following:

- **Input Validation**: Implement robust checks to handle invalid or incomplete input data gracefully.
- **User Interface**: Develop a graphical or command-line interface to simplify input configuration and result visualization.
- **Constraint Flexibility**: Enhance the scheduling algorithm to support additional constraints, such as teacher preferences or room capacity limits.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and logging for better debugging and user feedback.
- **Documentation**: Expand inline code comments and add detailed documentation for developers.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests to ensure reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

If you can help with any of these improvements, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.
